            <p>
                Greetings! My name is Lawrence Blundo. I am currently a food service associate for the University of New Hampshire in Durham, NH.
                Concurrently, I am enrolled in the UNH Coding Bootcamp learning about the world of web design. I graduated
                with a Bachelors of Science in Applied Meteorology from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University back in May 2020.
                Thanks to the UNH Coding Bootcamp, I am skilled in basic HTML formatting to creating a functional application 
                using MERN stack. My current endevors include programming a weather model using a deep nerual network (potentially
                adding a MERN stack weather app for users to view weather conditions based on the data) and continual observations on
                storm system developments across the nation. My zodiac sign is Sagitarrius, and my favorite hobbies include reading
                science fiction/horror novels and weather-watching.
